LeetCode Solutions Repository
=============================

Description
-----------
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems solved during
Data Structures and Algorithms practice. Each problem is organized in its
own folder using the respective LeetCode question number, making the
repository easy to navigate and reference.

The main goal of this repository is to improve problem-solving skills,
build strong DSA foundations, and maintain a structured archive for
interview preparation.

------------------------------------------------------------

Repository Structure
--------------------
Each LeetCode problem is stored in a separate folder named after its
question number.

Example structure:

/1_Two_Sum
/2_Add_Two_Numbers
/3_Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters
/20_Valid_Parentheses
/206_Reverse_Linked_List

Each folder may contain:
- Solution code file(s)
- Optional explanation or notes
- Multiple approaches (if applicable)

------------------------------------------------------------

Topics Covered
--------------
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps and Priority Queues

- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs (BFS / DFS)
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Bit Manipulation

------------------------------------------------------------

Languages Used
--------------
- C++
- Python

------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
- Practice and master Data Structures and Algorithms
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Maintain a clean, searchable solution archive
- Track long-term consistency in problem solving

------------------------------------------------------------

How to Use
----------
- Navigate to a folder using the problem number
- Read the solution code to understand the approach
- Try solving the problem independently before reviewing the solution
